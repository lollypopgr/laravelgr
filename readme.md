## Laravel.gr Greek Fans Page

[Based on the Laravel Framework and a few other awesome scripts]

Feel free to do what ever you want. Its a base for the Greek fan page.

### In progress

- [x] Random Image wide-screen banner (aka main theme). Planning to have a random theme each week.
- [x] Grab Greek Developer's thumbnails from Twitter, create a unified picture out of it and have it as a strip

If you want to translate the docs in Greek Language start translating the /docs folder. Merge Request to "Docs" branch please.
